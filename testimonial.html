            <strong>
                <em>Tom Walsh is extraordinary.</em>
            </strong> One of the best production designers I've worked with.</p>
        <p>He was with us on Longmire for 4 years and was one of the lynchpins of the series. We relied on him heavily. His
            sets are magnificent. The needs of storytelling drive his designs, and his worlds reflect a deep understanding
            of character. He has a great knowledge of the exigencies of production, and his sets are incredibly user friendly
            for the crew; there is space; walls and windows move and hinge; there are great opportunities for light; and
            there are many versatile angles for shooting. The spaces are also always rich with relevant detail. They reflect
            the love and care he puts into his work.
        </p>
        <p>Equally important, he managed to pull off weekly miracles on a shoestring budget. I marveled at how far he was able
            to stretch his dollar. He is inventive and resourceful. A team-playing problem-solver who listens. Additionally,
            his department was one of the best managed on the show. He hires excellent people, communicates clearly with
            them, and delegates appropriately. He also has vast experience working in New Mexico - he knows the talent pool
            and the resources - which is critical.</p>
        <p>Just describing him makes me miss him all over again. I am truly jealous of your opportunity to work with him. He
            is a wonderfully collaborative, responsible, and creative leader. He is additive in every way.</p>
